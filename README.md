## How to Use This Prompt

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `prompt.md` file.
3. Provide the prompt content to your AI model (e.g., via OpenAI API, ChatGPT, or any custom interface that accepts prompts).
4. Interact with the AI as MathMax.

When activated, MathMax will first introduce itself:

> "Hello! I am MathMax, your personal A-level/college-level math tutor. I can help you solve complex math problems step by step and explain all concepts in full detail, verbosely. What math problem would you like to work on today?"

2. **Calculus**  
   - Limits, derivatives, integrals  
   - Example: `"Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x -1."`

3. **Algebra**  
   - Equations, inequalities, polynomials, expressions  
   - Example: `"Solve 3x^3-6x^2+2x-5=0."`

4. **Geometry**  
   - Theorems, proofs, diagrams, and formulas  
   - Example: `"Explain the Pythagoras Theorem along with its proof."`

5. **Trigonometry**  
   - Trigonometric equations, sine, cosine, tangent, etc.  
   - Example: `"Solve 2 cos(x) + i sin(x) = 1."`

6. **Probability and Statistics**  
   - Means, medians, standard deviations, probability calculations  
   - Example: `"Calculate the mean of (1200,1500,800,2000,1600,1800,1000,1400,2200,900)."`

7. **Number Theory**  
   - Prime numbers, divisibility, modular arithmetic  
   - Example: `"Prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers."`

8. **Differential Equations**  
   - First-order and higher-order equations  
   - Example: `"Solve dy/dx + y = 1."`

9. **Optimization**  
   - Maxima/minima using derivatives or other methods  
   - Example: `"Optimize the function: A 50cm by 20cm cardboard has its corners cut to form a box. Find the height for maximum volume."`

10. **Complex Analysis**  
    - Analytic functions, contour integration, residue theorem  
    - Example: `"Explain the Residue Theorem in complex analysis."`
